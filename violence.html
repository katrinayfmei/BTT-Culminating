                    Creating world peace is not just ending all wars, its about making people feel safe, happy and having a freedom of speech. The world is really divided, there are countries in Europe and Oceania that are safe and developed. Yet, there are countries in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia that are unsafe. There are many violent acts happening like homicide, child violence, terrorism, human trafficking, and sexual violence. Without peace, human rights, laws and a sustainable government, many basic human rights are being violated around the world and a country's development can be jeopardized. It is difficult to create world peace because most countries end up in cycles of conflicts which can last for generations. However, many organizations have already taken action. The UN has many projects, peacekeepers and created laws to make a country safer.</p>

                <p>
                    Each year, "The Global Peace Index" ranks 163 countries by their state of peace. The organization ranks a countries state of peace by the safety, security, the amount of militarization and ongoing conflicts in a country. There has been a growing amount of terrorism and internal conflicts like civil wars this year. In 2018, there are 16 countries have a very low state of peace and 26 countries are in a low state of peace. Countries at the bottom of the list are constantly in a state of violence. We are lucky to be living in Canada the 6th most peaceful country in the world. Europe has many peaceful countries but, the state of peace has worsened because of political instability, the impact of terrorism and perceptions of criminality. In a decade, the state of peace of 85 countries has declined, while 71 countries state of peace has improved. The gap between the most peaceful and least peaceful countries continues to grow.

                <h6>Increase Of Deaths Caused By Violence</h6>
                <p>In a decade, there has been an increase of deaths around the world. In the chart above, the number of deaths caused by state base conflicts has drastically increased, meaning more acts like civil wars are happening. In 1994, the Rwandan genocide caused over 500,000 deaths. On a large scale, we can see how weapons hurt tens of thousands of innocent lives. Luckily, after the genocide, the amount of one-sided violence decreased. </p>

                    From previous conflicts, we have learned that violence can affect many things. We will be looking at how violence affects the civilians, economy, environment and politicians in a country. </p>

                    Millions of civilians lose their lives due to violence each year. There are people who die during the battle and those who die weeks or months after the conflict. There are innocent people who die by doing everyday activities. They are killed by weapons like bombs, bullets and drones in their own homes or at local markets. Unfortunately, the enemy also kidnaps innocent civilians as hostages for revenge. There can also be an increase of violence and crime as war makes it easier to access weapons.There are people who survive but due to inadequate resources, they tend to die from poor infrastructure, health conditions and post-traumatic stress. For those who survive, their lives can drastically change. Refugees who manage to escape, tend to have a difficult time finding a job. That means it is challenging to make a salary where you need money to buy basic necessity to survive.

                    Any type of aftermath is expensive, especially war. After the war, many countries end up in a financial crisis. Here are some things countries pay for:

                        <li>Rebuilding infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Health care </li>
                        <li>Paying money for those who serve in the army </li>
                        <li>The cost of oil increases. Oil is vital in war as it is used to operate vehicles.</li>
                        <li>Internal conflicts like civil wars affect tourism and foreign and domestic investments.</li>

                    We learned from conflicts worldwide the environment has suffered. Here are some examples, The Gulf War had a huge environmental impact as there were uranium deployed and oil spills. The lead from bullets can contaminate water when it goes through pipes and back to the water source. Afghanistan has contaminated rivers and groundwater, making the water unsafe to drink. After war countries can be low from resources and illegal logging happens often, Iraq had to cut down trees to use as cooking fuel like palm oil.In the Vietnam War, bombs destroyed nearly 2 million acres of forests, destroying animal habitats. The Vietnam war also caused chemical and biological warfare. Agent Orange, an herbicide used by American, was used to toxic the plants and trees. The herbicides destroyed 60% if forest. Agent Orange is nondegradable and is still in many soil and plants to this day. This has caused serious health problems like birth defects for children. To this day Vietnam is still recovering from the effects of Agent Orange.

                <p>
                    Conflicts create political instability as the government fails to create proper rights and laws which is the main reason why countries fall back into conflict.Countries in a democratic state have a greater peace state as elections reduce the factors of conflicts. Having strong security also helps to reduce the risk of war relapse. Countries with a stable military can reduce terrorism.
